Cocaine is an illegal and highly addictive stimulant that causes a range of severe harms to the body and mind, both in the short and long term. Its effects stem from its interference with brain chemistry, particularly by causing a buildup of dopamine, which leads to feelings of euphoria and high energy.

### Physical Harms

Cocaine has a devastating impact on the **cardiovascular system**, causing increased heart rate, high blood pressure, and constricted blood vessels, which significantly raise the risk of a heart attack, stroke, and cardiac arrest, even in young, healthy people. Long-term use can lead to permanent damage to the heart muscle and blood vessels.

The specific method of use also causes distinct physical damage:
* **Snorting** cocaine can destroy the nasal septum, leading to a loss of smell, chronic nosebleeds, and a collapsed nasal structure.
* **Smoking** crack cocaine can cause respiratory problems, including lung damage, asthma, and pneumonia.
* **Injecting** cocaine increases the risk of infectious diseases like HIV and hepatitis C from shared needles, as well as collapsed veins and abscesses at injection sites.

Cocaine also harms other organs, including the **kidneys** and **liver**, and can lead to gastrointestinal problems due to reduced blood flow.

### Mental and Neurological Harms

Cocaine's effect on dopamine in the brain is what makes it so addictive. Over time, the brain's natural ability to produce dopamine is reduced, leading to a dependency where the user needs more of the drug just to feel normal. This can cause severe **depression**, **anxiety**, and a profound inability to feel pleasure when not using.

Chronic use can also lead to a variety of neurological and psychological issues, including:
* **Cognitive decline**, affecting memory, attention, and decision-making.
* **Psychosis**, characterized by paranoia, aggression, and hallucinations.
* **Erratic and violent behavior** due to changes in brain function and impulsivity.

The crash that follows a cocaine high often leads to irritability, fatigue, and intense drug cravings, fueling a dangerous cycle of addiction.
